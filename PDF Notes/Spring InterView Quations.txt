8.Why Do We Need Spring Profiles:-
When developing applications for the enterprise, we typically deal with multiple environments such as Dev, QA, and Prod. The configuration properties for these environments are different.

For example, we might be using an embedded H2 database for Dev, but Prod could have the proprietary Oracle or DB2. Even if the DBMS is the same across environments, the URLs would definitely be different.

To make this easy and clean, Spring has the provision of profiles, to help separate the configuration for each environment. So that instead of maintaining this programmatically, 
the properties can be kept in separate files such as application-dev.properties and application-prod.properties. 
The default application.properties points to the currently active profile using "spring.profiles.active" so that the correct configuration is picked up

9.What are the Spring Boot Annotations?
The @RestController is a stereotype annotation. It adds @Controller and @ResponseBody annotations to the class. 
We need to import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation package in our file, in order to implement it.

10.What is @RequestMapping annotation in Spring Boot?
The @RequestMapping annotation is used to provide routing information. It tells to the Spring that any HTTP request should map to the corresponding method. 
We need to import org.springframework.web.annotation package in our file.
