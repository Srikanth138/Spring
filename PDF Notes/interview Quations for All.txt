6.how to copy two arrays in one single Array
int[] firstArray = {23,45,12,78,4,90,1};//source array  
int[] secondArray = {77,11,45,88,32,56,3};//destination array  
int fal = firstArray.length;//determines length of firstArray  
int sal = secondArray.length;//determines length of secondArray  
int[] result = new int[fal + sal];  //resultant array of size first array and second array  
System.arraycopy(firstArray, 0, result, 0, fal);  
System.arraycopy(secondArray, 0, result, fal, sal);  
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(result));    //prints the resultant array  
}  
}  
Output:
[23, 45, 12, 78, 4, 90, 1, 77, 11, 45, 88, 32, 56, 3]
